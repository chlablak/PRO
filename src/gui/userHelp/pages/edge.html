    <h1>Edge</h1>
    <hr size="2" width="100%">
    <h2>Declaration</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>Very much like a vertex, an edge can be simply declared as a
      connection between two vertices:</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> <code>e = (0--1);</code></p>
    <p> but it can also include information such as weight, a label, max
      capacity and min capacity. These properties must be separated by a
      <code>:</code> colon and are all optional. Here are two examples
      of how this can be done, using only the label property and using
      the max capacity and min capacity:
    </p>
    <p><code>e = (0--1:"myFirstEdge");</code></p>
    <p><code>e = (0--1:::5:2);</code></p>
    <p>the complete grammar for declaring an edge is:</p>
    <p><code>variableName =
        (firstVertex--SecondVertex:"label":weight:maxCap:minCap);
      </code></p>
    <h2><br>Edge ID</h2>
    <p>Each edge has an ID that is local to the connection. A connection
      is a symbolic relationship between two vertices. This means there
      can be as many edges with the same ID as there are pairs in a
      graph. This ID is mainly used to differentiate edges when removing
      one from a connection containing many edges.
    </p>
    <h2><br>Adding edges to a graph</h2>
    <p>To add an edge to a graph, the two vertices connected to this
      edge must already be present. This rule is applicable for
      anonymous declaration between the <code>{ }</code> braces and
      also for addition to the graph using the <code>+=</code>
      operator. This means the following declaration:</p>
    <p><code>g = {0,1,1--2,2,3};</code></p>
    <p>is not valid, and should instead be written:</p>
    <p><code>g = {0,1,2,1--2,3};</code> or <code>g = {0,1,2,3,1--2};</code>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The <code>+=</code> operator works the same way as with
      vertices. You can therefore add anonymous edges:</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><code>g += (0--1);</code></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>as well as edges previously declared:</p>
    <p><code>g += e;
      </code></p>
    <h2><br>Modifying an existing edge</h2>
    <p>Modifying the properties of an edge can be done using the <code>+=</code>
      operator. To do so, you must specify the vertices that define the
      edge and its local ID with the <code>[ ]</code> brackets, which
      should be visible in the graphical representation. For example:
    </p>
    <p><code>g = {#3};</code><code></code></p>
    <p><code></code><code>g += (0--1::5);</code><code></code></p>
    <p><code></code><code>g += (0--1[0]::3);</code>
    </p>
    <p>will change the weight of the current edge from <samp>5</samp>
      to <samp>3</samp>.
    </p>
    <p>If the ID specified does not exit (<code>0</code> in the example
      above), this command will have the effect of adding a new edge to
      the graph.
    </p>
    <p>Note: parameters are passed by value, so modifying them after
      adding them to the graph will not have any influence. More on this

    </p>
    <h2><br>Removing edges from a graph</h2>
    <p>Removing all the edges between two vertices is accomplished with
      the <code>-= </code>operator, e.g.:
    </p>
    <p><code>g -= (0--1);</code>
    </p>
    <p>If you with however to remove one of many parallel edges, you can
      do so using their ID, for example:
    </p>
    <p><code>g -= (0--1[1]);</code>
    </p>
    <p>And you can also remove many edges from different connections,
      using the <code>[ ]</code> brackets:
    </p>
    <p><code>g -= [(0--1[0]), (1--2)];
      </code></p>
    <h2><br>Directed edges</h2>
    <p>As well as <code>--</code> regular edges shown above, a graph
      can be composed of <code>-&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;- </code>directed

      edges. Adding one of these to a graph already containing regular
      edges will change the graph type to a directed graph and create
      two directed edges of opposite direction between the appropriate
      vertices. For example:</p>
    <p><code>dg = {#3, 0--1};</code><code>
      </code></p>
    <p><code>dg += (1-&gt;2);</code>
    </p>
    <p>will create the same graph as:
    </p>
    <p><code>dg = {#3, 0-&gt;1, 1-&gt;0, 1-&gt;2};
      </code></p>
    <p>All the rules specified above also apply to these directed
      graphs.
