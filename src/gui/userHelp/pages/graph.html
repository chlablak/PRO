    <h1>Graph</h1>

    <h2>Declaring a new graph</h2>
    <p>There are many ways to declare a graph, from a simple empty
      graph:<br>
    </p>
    <p><code>g = { };<br>
      </code> </p>
    <p>to a graph containing a certain number of elements:</p>
    <p><code>g = {#3};</code><br>
    </p>
    <p>to more complex declarations with labels, weights and capacities.
      One important rule to note, is that the use of the <code>#</code>
      shortcut for multiple vertices must be the first element in the <code>{
        }</code> braces.</p>
    <p>If you wish to declare a graph with <a href="vertex.html">vertices</a>
      and <a href="edge.html">edges</a>, it can be done by including
      them between the <code>{ }</code> braces:</p>
    <p><code>g = {0,1,2,0--1,1--2};</code><br>
    </p>
    <p>or by adding them with the <code>+=</code> operator;<br>
    </p>
    <p><code>g += (3);</code><br>
    </p>
    <p>for a vertex with the ID <code>3</code>, or<br>
    </p>
    <p><code>g += (1--2);</code><br>
    </p>
    <p>for an edge joining the edges <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>.
      There are two important rules adding elements to a graph:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>When adding a vertex to a graph, all the previous IDs up the
        the current one must be already used (e.g. one can only add the
        vertex <code>3</code> if the vertices <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>
        and <code>2</code> already exist in the graph). This also means
        vertices must be added in order when declaring or adding them to
        the graph. For instance <code>g = {0,1,2,3}</code> is correct,
        while <code>g = {1,2,3,0}</code> is not.</li>
      <li>Edges can only be added between already existing vertices. For
        instance <code>g = {0,1,2,1--2}</code> is correct, while <code>g
          = {0,1,2,2--3}</code> and <code>g = {0,1,1--2,2}</code> are
        both incorrect.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Declaring a graph with vertices or edges<br>
    </h2>
    <p>For now, it is only possible to declare a non-empty graph with
      anonymous edges and vertices, therefore:</p>
    <p><code>g = {0,1,2};</code></p>
    <p>is valid, while:</p>
    <p><code>v = (0);</code></p>
    <p><code>w = (1);</code></p>
    <p><code>g = {v,w};</code></p>
    <p>is not. This possibility will hopefully be implemented in the
      future. For now, you should declare an empty graph and add element
      with the <code>+=</code> operator.<br>
